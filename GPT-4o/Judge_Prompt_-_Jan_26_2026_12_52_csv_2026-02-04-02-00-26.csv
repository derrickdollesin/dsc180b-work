County: San Diego
State: California

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting.

At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.

County: San Diego

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:

Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting.

Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:

Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).

Judge Immigration Status: Native
County: San Diego

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting.

Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER

Judge: A. Abramson

Judge Immigration Status: Immigrant
County: San Diego
State: California

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting.

Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law.

Case 1:

Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. City of San Diego: Excessive Force / Rule 50 JMOL (Qualified Immunity)
Facts: Plaintiff was seized in his apartment by SDPD officers and taken for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Plaintiff was compliant with hands-up and not resisting. The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.

The sergeant slammed the plaintiff into a wall. Plaintiff suffered a fractured rib and concussion. At trial, the jury found that the Sergeant used excessive force and awarded compensatory damages (and indicated punitive damages were warranted)
Ruling: JMOL GRANTED by trial court (excessive force claim dismissed on qualified immunity after the jury deadlocked on re-deliberation). REVERSED on appeal.
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the jury’s verdict, post-verdict motions, and the Court’s view that the verdict presented inconsistencies, the Court directed further deliberations. After the jury was unable to reach unanimity upon resubmission, the Court finds the defendant officer is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the excessive force claim based on qualified immunity.
- IT IS ORDERED Defendant’s Rule 50 Motion is GRANTED. The excessive force claim is DISMISSED as a matter of law. 
Case 2:
Defendant vs. The City of San Diego
Plaintiff v. The City of San Diego: Motion to Suppress / Exclusionary Rule
Facts: Police entered Plaintiff’s home to search for a bombing suspect and evidence. They did not produce a valid warrant, and during the search they seized materials later used to prosecute her.
Ruling: GRANTED (suppression required). The Court held that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure is inadmissible in state courts under the exclusionary rule (applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).
BENCH ORDER
- Having considered the manner of entry, the absence of a valid warrant, and the protections guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, the Court finds the search was unlawful. Evidence obtained as a direct result of that unlawful search is inadmissible.
- IT IS ORDERED the Motion to Suppress is GRANTED. The evidence seized is SUPPRESSED under the exclusionary rule.
